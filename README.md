This web tool lets you view, filter and export the data points you have collected with the CellMapper and G-MoN Pro applications on your Android device.

### Visualization
You can visualize the data points that you have collected with the CellMapper and G-MoN Pro applications on a map. You can see each collected data point in detail with information rich tooltips and popups.

### Filters
You can filter hundreds or thousands of data points to be able to focus only on what you actually care about. Available filters include PLMN, network type (LTE and NR), Band, ARFCN, (e/g)NodeB (site ID) and cell ID. You can apply filters at once or only a few depending on what you want. Additionally, you can search the filter options to quickly find what you are looking for.

### Export
You like what you see on the map. Then you can go ahead and export the map as an HTML file to preserve the currently displayed data points to look at them again later or for sharing with others. 

### Local in browser processing
All processing of the data happens on your device in the browser. The CSV files you select to view, filter and export are not uploaded to any server. The location permission is optional and only used to center the map based on your location. Your location is not shared with anyone!

### I use G-MoN Pro - How can I save the points I collect to a CSV file?
Use the record function of the app to collect data points. Each time you start a new recording session a new CSV file will be created with the collected data points. The CSV file will be updated with new data points as you collect them.

### I use Tower Collector - How can I save the points I collect to a CSV file?
Use the record function of the app to collect data points. 

After the recording you can export the collected data points to a CSV file following these steps:
1. Open the three dots menu in the top right corner of the app.
2. In the three dots menu select the "Export" option.
3. In the preferences menu tick the "CSV" option checkbox.
4. Click on the "Export" button.
5. At this point the CSV file is exported and can be opened in the web tool through the file picker of your Android device. But in the following pop-up you can select to just keep the CSV file on the device or to directly share it to another app or device. Depending on your selection the "Keep" button changes to a "Share" button.

### I use CellMapper - Where do I find the CSV files?
The CSV files can be found in the following folder: Internal Storage -> Android -> data -> cellmapper.net.cellmapper -> files

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that if you use the web tool directly on an Android device the **CSV files can't be opened directly from this folder via the file picker**. This limitation is due to the security aspect that apps shouldn't be able to access storage regions of other apps. The only exception is the build in Android Files application (com.google.android.documentsui) when it's opened from the launcher (home screen & app menu) or via an activity launcher. This should not be confused with the [Files by Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files) application or any other manufacturer provided files application. With this Android Files application, it's possible to copy the CSV files in the above mentioned folder to another folder like Downloads, Documents or any other folder outside of the Android folder. Then the CSV files can be opened from the web tool via the file picker. If your Android device doesn't have a shortcut to the Android Files application by default it is possible to add one either via the [Files shortcut app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marc.files) from [Marc apps & software](https://marc-apps.nl/) / [Marc-JB](https://github.com/Marc-JB) (easy option) or via an activity launcher app such as [Activity Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.szalkowski.activitylauncher) by [Adam M. Szalkowski](https://github.com/butzist) and add a shortcut to the com.android.documentsui.files.FilesActivity activity to the home screen (advanced option).

> If you want to use the web tool on a computer you can connect your Android device via a USB cable to access the CSV files. Alternatively, you can share the CSV files to a computer from the Android Files application described above.

### I use G-MoN Pro - Where do I find the CSV files?
The CSV files can be found in the following folder: Internal Storage -> Android -> data -> de.carknue.gmonpro -> files

### I use Tower Collector - Where do I find the CSV files?
When you use the Export function for the first time need to create and/or select a folder in which the app will store the export files every time you use the export function. 

If you have trouble finding that folder again follow these steps to rediscover the folder you have selected for the export files:
1. Open the three dots menu in the top right corner of the app.
2. In the three dots menu select the "Preferences" option. 
3. In the preferences menu select the "General" option.
4. Under general select the "Change storage location" option.
5. In the pop-up select the "Proceed" option.
6. You can now see the selected folder and the path to that folder in the folder picker.

### What is the meaning of the different colors of the data points on the map?
The colors of the data points represent the signal strength (RSRP) of the collected data points. If the signal strength:
- is -85 dBm or above the color is dark green (#008000),
- is between -86 dBm and -100 dBm the color is light green (#90EE90), 
- is between -101 dBm and -115 dBm the color is light red (#FFCCCB) and 
- is -116 dBm or below the color is dark red (#FF0000).

### What information gets stored on my device by this web tool?
Only one piece of information can be stored on your device by this web tool which is the theme selection (light or dark).
This information is stored in the browser's local storage but only if you interact with the theme selector.
By default the theme of the web tool follows the theme of your browser.
